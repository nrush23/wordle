I realize that we covered a lot of material this week, but we didn't actually finish the material on implicit surfaces,
so this week the assignment is just going to build on the first half of the lecture. You will get to play with implicit surfaces next week. :-)
I've included all of the source code for the first half of the lecture, in which we discussed how to make an infinitely scalable line font.
In webgl.js I have included the data for that line font itself, as well as the two text examples (the beginning of Charles Dickens' "A Tale of Two Cities" and a snippet of code).
Your assignment is to create a 3D scene or animation that builds on this technique. Your scene should consist of shapes that are defined as line paths of constant width.
Add camera movement into the scene so that a viewer can see it from different points of view. I encourage you to use splines in creating the paths that define the shapes.
Remember that you can also use any of the other techniques that we have covered so far, including noise-based procedural textures, spring-based dynamics and inverse kinematics.
And of course you can now add explanatory text and signage into your scene.
