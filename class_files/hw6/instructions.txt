Attached is all of the modeling, rendering and animation's code from this week's lecture, including the Utah Teapot data.
In class we covered a number of spline-related topics, including using splines to create shapes and to do animation.
Because splines are so general in their power, I am going to open up this assignment to your own preference as to which aspects of computer graphics
you would like to learn about and explore this week. On a spline-related topic of your choice, while building on the code that I have provided here,
create something original. You can focus on building interesting shapes based on spline curves or bicubic spline patches, or animation that relies on
using splines to vary matrices over time, or an interactive system in the general spirit of my spline editor to allow users to interactively
modify aspects of a scene. Or you can address all of those capabilities. Make something surprising, original and beautiful. Have fun with it!
