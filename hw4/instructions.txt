For assignment 4, create your own original procedural textures. I have attached the procedural textures that we created in class, which you can use as reference.

Note that I have added an implementation of the noise function into this version of webgl.js, so that will always be available in your fragment shader.

See if you can create the appearance of different natural materials. It helps to look at nature around you for inspiration (I do).

If you like, you can put your procedural textures on objects built from quadric surfaces that you raytrace to, as in the previous assignment.

For extra credit, you can also try to implement reflection and refraction. I have included in the attachment the figure that I shared during class which shows how to use Snell's law to change the direction of a ray as it passes through a refracting surface.
